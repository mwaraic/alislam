                     \\'view, two appear to be the more\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'noteworthy.One is that ( (Moses)\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'is an Egyptian name occurring in\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'many combinations of that language\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'e.g., Amenmesse, Ahmosi, Thotmes,\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'Ramose, etc.the

           \\'of these words\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'would indicate that these Egyptian\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'names are really different from the\\\\n\\'\\n

                  \\'Moses to be of Egyptian origin, there\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'is no justification for assuming that\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'the man Moses was not Israelite but\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'Egyptian by birth.As Israelites were\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'a subject people in Egypt, living\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'under the rule of

shown above, the fact\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'remains that is a Hebrew name,\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'having definite derivation in both\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'Hebrew

                 \\'Moses, asking him to strike the water\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'with his rod.This being the time of\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'ebb-tide, the sea receded, exposing to\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'view in the bed of the sea huge\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'mounds of dry sand interspersed with\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'depressions filled with

\\'opposite bank.The army of Pharaoh\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'came in pursuit, and while they were\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'yet in the bed of the sea the high tide\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'returned and drowned them all.It should be remembered \\'\\n                      \\'that,\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'according to the Quran, a miracle is\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'purely the work of God, and man has\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'no hand in it.So, the striking of the\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'sea by Moses was merely a symbol or\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'a sign, having nothing to do with the\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'actual parting of the sea which was\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'exclusively the

through the bed of the sea also\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'indicates that it was the time of the\\\\n\\'\\n                      \\'ebb-tide.If the sea had been actually\\\\n\\'\\n

              "  AIMessage(content='The Arabic phrase \"إنما الأعمال بالنيات\" (Innamal A\\'malu bin Niyyat) means **\"Surely, the actions of men will be judged by the intention or the motive with which they are performed.\"**\\n\\nThis is a well-known saying of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and is recorded in the collection of Hadith, particularly in Bukhari.\\n\\nThe commentary explains that this principle is related to the concept of accountability in Islam. While God knows what is in our minds, He will not hold us accountable for fleeting or momentary thoughts that are beyond our control. Instead, accountability is for the evil thoughts that are cherished and harbored, and for the evil designs that are knowingly evolved and contemplated. This is in line with the Quranic principle that \"Allah burdens not any soul beyond its capacity\" (The Holy Quran, 2:287).\\n\\nThe Holy Prophet further elaborated on this, stating that if a servant intends to do an evil deed but does not carry it out, it is not written against him; if he carries it out, it is written down. If he intends to do a good deed but abstains from it, it is written as one good act, and if he actually does a good deed, it is noted as ten acts of virtue (Tirmidhī).\\n\\n(Pg. 813)\\nRelevant Quranic verses:\\n*   https://www.alislam.org/quran/app/2:285\\n*   https://www.alislam.org/quran/app/2:287', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--ae96d417-d250-47fc-807f-06cf5da25d86-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 79895, 'output_tokens': 334, 'total_tokens': 80759, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 530}})]}"
